Welcome to CHEVERSE, where we will create a fully decentralized parallel universe on the Internet. Set against the backdrop of a contentious, unfair, and chaotic continent, the CHE organization has begun the revival of the Che Guevara plan, cultivating revolutionary cells of Che Guevara using the characteristics of blockchain technology in a secret base on the network. The cultivated cells are successfully implanted into new life forms after passing tests. The CHE organization is well aware of the current state of the modern gaming industry and has decided to adopt Che Guevara's revolutionary spirit to break the monopoly system and unleash the creativity of players.

In the parallel universe of CHEVERSE, we will construct a complete social system through the form of games. The name CHEVERSE is derived from the great revolutionary leader Che Guevara, symbolizing uniqueness, the pursuit of rebellion, and authentic cultural symbols. Ultimately, we will build the entire CHEVERSE based on this spirit.

## PUBLIC GAME

What is PUBLIC GAME?

- Once established, PUBLIC GAME is unstoppable, creating a positive and shared economic system built by all participants.
- It features Universal Basic Income (UBI), where all participants share the income generated by the protocol itself. The income is obtained through the Harberger Tax, and the generated revenue is used to issue tokens to users as collateral.
- It does not require permission and operates on a trusted neutral platform.
- It is self-generative. Anyone can build their own applications, ecosystems, and economic systems (issuing tokens) within the game, driving the game's growth independently rather than being driven by the game's founding team.
- It emphasizes governance and the game mechanism is closely tied to governability. Users determine the direction of ecosystem development through quadratic voting within the application.
Value introduction: Anyone can introduce value in some form.
